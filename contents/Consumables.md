# CONSUMABLES

Consumables are loot that can only be used once. You can hold up to five of each consumable at a time. Using a consumable doesn’t require a roll unless required by the GM or the demands of the fiction.

To generate a random consumable, choose a rarity, roll the designated dice, and match the total to the item in the table:

- **Common:** 1d12 or 2d12
- **Uncommon:** 2d12 or 3d12
- **Rare:** 3d12 or 4d12
- **Legendary:** 4d12 or 5d12
